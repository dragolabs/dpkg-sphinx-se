## Options build.sh
* `-s` - version of sphinxsearch
* `-p` - version of percona server
* `-d` - version of percona server in Debian repo
* `-o` - optional. Used to mark the iteration of the package (example: wheezy1, myorg2, etc)

bundle install
build.sh -s 2.1.9 -p 5.6.19-67.0 -d 5.6.19-67.0-618.trusty -o trusty
